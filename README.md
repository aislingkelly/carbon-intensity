# PowerUp

## Overview

PowerUp is a web application designed to help users minimise their carbon footprint by leveraging real-time data from the [National Grid ESO's Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/). The application provides users with current information on the carbon intensity of the power grid, enabling them to choose the best times to consume electricity, particularly when renewable energy sources are most available.
