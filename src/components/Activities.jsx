                At home, a number of activities usually take up lots of energy
                but can be made flexible for times of better carbon intensity.
                It comes in handy when the supplier to your house adopts
                cleaner, eco-friendlier approaches such as the renewable
                sources.

          Laundry (Washing and Drying): These appliances take up a significant
          share of energy. Washing your clothes during low-carbon intensity
          hours, for example, those offering the highest concentration of
          renewable sources such as wind or solar can help reduce a huge
          fraction of the carbon which is attributed to such chores from your
          carbon footprint. Dishwashing: A dishwasher uses a lot of energy,
          especially in heating and drying the dishes. Start the dishwasher at
          times when the carbon intensity is low like midday in areas where
          there is high solar generation which will be more greener. Electric
          Vehicle (EV) Charging: Charging EVs for the households having these
          vehicles can draw huge power. Aligning the time of charging the
          vehicles with the time frames carrying lesser carbon intensity, say
          overnight in regions where wind energy is available, might help the
          situation to some extent reduce carbon impact. Heating and Cooling:
          Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are among
          the largest emitters of carbon. Simple changes in when these systems
          operate, so that they work more during periods of low carbon
          intensity, could help. This might include such simple measures as
          changing of indoor targets and using programmable thermostats. For
          example, the pre-heating in which one will take out during periods of
          low carbon intensity and then retain the warmth using a very efficient
          insulation. Cooking: Cooking process has a larger set of appliances
          ranging from electric oven and stovetop, both are energy intensive.
          Designating their usage to coincide cleavage of cleaner energy period
          times will reduce carbon footprints. Water Heating: Electrical heated
          water is a major source of energy. Timing the use of electric water
          heaters to coincide with periods when the carbon intensity of
          electricity generation is lower (e.g. for showers, baths or washing
          up) could make a difference. High-Power Electronics and Appliances:
          Such appliances like a vacuum cleaner, hairdryer or power tools can be
          timed however is most convenient to coincide with low-carbon. By
          monitoring the carbon intensity of the grid households can help to
          contribute to a collective lower carbon output by moving these
          activities into times which have more renewable energy sources
          present. This strategy is gaining increasing practicability with
          arrival of smart home systems and energy management apps which can
          help the customers be aware with their power consumptions.
