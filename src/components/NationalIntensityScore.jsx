        Carbon intensity is a measure of how clean our electricity is.
        Specifically, how many grams of carbon dioxide are released to produce a
        kilowatt hour of electricity. Fossil fuels are very carbon intensive,
        whereas renewable energy is carbon-free. This gauge shows, in real time,
        the carbon intensity of Great Britainâ€™s electricity, which is made up of
        a range of sources.
