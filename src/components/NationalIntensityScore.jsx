        Carbon intensity is a measure of how clean our electricity is.
        Specifically, how many grams of carbon dioxide are released to produce a
        kilowatt hour of electricity. Fossil fuels are very carbon intensive,
        whereas renewable energy is carbon-free.

      The current carbon intesity for all of Great Britain is{' '}
      {intensityScore[0].intensity.actual} gCO2/kWh and is classed as{' '}
      {intensityScore[0].intensity.index}
